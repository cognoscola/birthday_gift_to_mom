# Birthday Gift to Mom
Just a simple android app which uses libgdx and android UI to create a birthday "card" experience for my mom.

- When they open up the app they will see an animated screen with Giant "Happy Birthay" Text come into the foregroud.
- They can set a time to receive daily suprises 
- Each daily surprise is a combination of a picture from the past and a motivational quote
